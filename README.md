About CyberCrack

Hi, I am hackerplaz and, this is a developing tool. My inspiration to code this tool was the Metasploit-framework. I coded this tool with python and, this is version 0.1 so, this is the first version and can expect bugs but, CyberCrack is great for information gathering, wireless payloads, and a shell, like meterpreter. So, this is how to install and configure the tool.

Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the folder and, make the python script executable using chmod +x CyberCrack.py.
3. Execute the install. sh.
4. And then go to terminal and type, sudo python3 CyberCrack.py
5. Then you should see a shell open after a few times 
6. Type the command show options to list the available options.
